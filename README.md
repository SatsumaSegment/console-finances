# Console Finances
This is the fourth challenge in the Front-End Skills Bootcamp.

This is a JavaScript challenge, in which, I have been given an array of finances which contains two fields, one displays the date and the other displays profits/losses.

I have been tasked with writing a JavaScript program which analyzes the given array to calculate and display data that the company might find useful, such as, the number of months in the dataset and the total profits/losses.

The first thing I chose to do was to declare all the variables that would be of use in he program. I have a section for all variables I will use to display data to the user, and another section for variables that I will use to help me retrieve that data; as seen in the image below.
